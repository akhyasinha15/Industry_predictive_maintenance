# Industry_predictive_maintenance

# Problem Statement :- 
  Unplanned machinery breakdowns in industries (manufacturing, energy, transportation, etc.) lead to significant financial losses due to:
     - Production Stoppages: Halting entire assembly lines or critical operations.
     - High Repair Costs: Emergency repairs are often more expensive and require expedited parts.
     - Safety Risks: Malfunctioning machinery can pose serious hazards to workers.
     - Reduced Equipment Lifespan: Reactive maintenance often means parts are replaced after catastrophic failure, damaging other components. Current maintenance practices are often time-based (e.g., replace every 6 months) or reactive (fix only after breakdown), both of which are inefficient and costly.

# Architecture :- 
1. *Data Ingestion Layer:* Simulating data from sensors
2. *Feature Engineering:* Extracting meaningful features from raw sensor data such as - moving averages, standard deviations, frequency components from vibration data. 
3. *Machine Learning Model:*
    1. *For Anomaly Detection :* Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM could be used to detect outliers in the multi-dimensional sensor data.
    2. *For Predictive Classification (more complex but powerful):* Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost/LightGBM), or even a simple Logistic Regression if the problem is linearly separable, trained on historical data to predict 'healthy' vs. 'failing' states. Given the 2-day deadline, Isolation Forest for anomaly detection is the most achievable.
4. *Alerting Mechanism:* A simple output showing detected anomalies or predictions.

# Proof of concept :- 

*Scenario:* Monitoring a single "Industrial Pump" with two key sensors: "Vibration Amplitude" and "Motor Temperature."

*Data Generation:*
1. For the first X minutes/data points, the pump runs normally (stable vibration, stable temp).
2. After X minutes, simulate a deteriorating pump:
    1. Vibration amplitude starts steadily increasing and becoming erratic.
    2. Motor temperature starts a slow, but steady, climb.

*AI Detection:* Code will be 
1. Continuously read new simulated sensor data points.
2. Preprocess them 
3. Feed them to the trained IsolationForest model.
4. When the model detects an outlier (i.e., when the vibration and temperature patterns deviate significantly from the "healthy" data it was trained on), it will print an "Anomaly Detected: Pump P-001 might fail soon!" alert.

*Visualization:* A simple plot updating in real-time showing sensor values and highlighting when an anomaly is detected.
